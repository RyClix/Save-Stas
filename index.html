            My friend Stas is amazing.
            It’s strange, but I didn’t truly realize that until I found out he was going to die.
            That it was going to happen soon.
            That it was real.
            
            Then I started thinking — about everything.
            Things I hadn’t thought about in years.
            I guess I just took him for granted.
            I mean, friends are always just there, right?
            You assume they’ll always be around — to laugh with you, call you out, make dumb jokes,
            Or just be someone to talk to when everything else feels off.

            You don’t really think about what it would feel like to lose that.
            Not until you're told it might actually happen.

            Everything’s been different since Stas got his diagnosis.
            Since I realized that soon… he might not be here anymore.
            <br>
            <br>
            Now, I feel lucky when I get a text from him.
            I feel lucky when he sends a meme that makes no sense, or tells me some random story from his day.
            I even feel lucky when he complains — because it means he’s still here.
            Still Stas. Still my friend.

            And I’m not ready to lose that.
